# StopWatch
Click Start to start timer, click stop to pause or reset to reset the timer :)
One of the first thing I built after doing an online JS course for beginners. 

# Technologies and tools
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Visual Studio Code
- (Made this before I knew about Git and Github.)

# Lessons and changes
- Save IntervalId and use it to not have multiple timers running when pressing start multiple times.
- Set hours, minutes and seconds

What I would change/add
- Add milliseconds
- Make the timer be able to count down from a time the user sets
